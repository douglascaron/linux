Broadcom Cygnus CRMU Timer

The always on Cortex-M0 MCU processor provides a timer that can be read using
the mailbox controller. It is used on Cygnus as a persistent clock across power
management state transitions.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "brcm,cygnus-crmu-timer"
- mboxes: A phandle specifying the mailbox controller and channel used to
  communicate with the M0 processor.

Example:

	cygnus_crmu_timer: cygnus_crmu_timer {
		compatible = "brcm,cygnus-crmu-timer";
		mboxes = <&mailbox 4>;
	};
