BROADCOM NORTHSTAR2 USB2 HOST PHY

This USB 2.0 host PHY is used in Northstar2 platform.
There are two such PHYs connected to two EHCI/OHCI controllers.

Required PHY properties:
 - compatible: brcm,ns2-usb2-phy
 - reg: Address and length of the NS2 PHY related registers.
 - reg-names:
   The below registers must be provided.
	usb2-idm-ctl: IDM control registers
	usb2-phy-ctl: Phy control registers
	usb2-icfg-sts: ICFG register to check PLL lock status
 - #phy-cells: Must be 0. No args required.
 - usb-ctl-syscon: Handler of syscon node to access NS2 CRMU USB
	control registers. There are 2 registers - one for USB2
	 and other for USB3.
 - brcm,ns2-usbh-afe: The AFE bit value for USB2 phy

Optional PHY properties:
 - brcm,ns2-inv-ppc-pol: This property is optional. This can be
	provided when ppc inversion/overcurrent polarity bits needs
	to be reversed in the ehci_ohci_strap register.

Required CRMU USB control properties:
 - compatibility strings: "brcm,ns2-crmu-usbctl", "syscon"
 - reg: The CRMU USB control registers address and length.
	There are 2 registers - one each for USB2 and USB3.

Refer to phy/phy-bindings.txt for the generic PHY binding properties

Example:
	crmu_usb_ctl: syscon@6501d144 {
		compatible = "brcm,ns2-crmu-usbctl", "syscon";
		reg = <0x6501d144 0x8>;
	};

	usbphy0: usbphy@67010800 {
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "brcm,ns2-usb2-phy";
		reg = <0x67010408 0x400>,
		      <0x66490200 0x600>,
		      <0x66000888 0x4>;
		reg-names = "usb2-idm-ctl",
			    "usb2-phy-ctl",
			    "usb2-icfg-sts";
		usb-ctl-syscon = <&crmu_usb_ctl>;
		brcm,ns2-usbh-afe = <13>;
	};
