BROADCOM OMEGA USB PHY

Required Properties:
- compatible:  brcm,omega-usb-phy
- reg : cdru usb phy (hs_ss_icfg_usb20phy) control and reset registers,
  usb host idm registers.
- reg-names: a list of the names corresponding to the previous register
  ranges. Should contain "cdru-usbphy", "usb2h-idm".
- address-cells: should be 1
- size-cells: should be 0
- brcm,usbphy-crmu-syscon:  a phandle to the crmu syscon area that contains phy
                            control regs.

Sub-nodes:
  A port PHY should be represented as a sub-node.

Sub-nodes required properties:
- reg: the PHY number, must be 0
- #phy-cells must be 0

Optional Properties:
- vbus-supply : The regulator for vbus out control.

Refer to phy/phy-bindings.txt for the generic PHY binding properties

Example of phy :
	usbphy: phy@28430100 {
		compatible = "brcm,omega-usb-phy";
		reg = <0x28430100 0x3c>,
		      <0x28800000 0xa00>;
		reg-names = "cdru-usbphy",
                                   "usb2h-idm";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		brcm,usbphy-crmu-syscon = <&crmu_syscon>;

		usbphy0: phy@0 {
			#phy-cells = <0>;
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};

Example of node using the phy:
	ehci: usb@28400000 {
		compatible = "generic-ehci";
		reg = <0x28400000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 82 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		phys = <&usbphy0>;
		phy-names = "usbp0";
		status = "okay";
	};
