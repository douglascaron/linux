* Broadcom NS2 PCIe PHY binding document

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "brcm,ns2-pcie-phy"
- brcm,phy_internal: NS2 only has internal MDIO phys
- reg: MDIO chain number for the MDIO interface
- #address-cells: must be 1
- #size-cells: must be 0

This is a child node of "brcm,iproc-shared-mdio"

Required properties for child nodes:
- reg: MDIO Phy ID for the MDIO interface
- #phy-cells: must be 0


Example:

pci-master@0 {
	compatible = "brcm,ns2-pcie-phy";
	brcm,phy_internal;
	reg = <0x0>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	pci_phy0: pci-phy@0 {
		reg = <0x0>;
		#phy-cells = <0>;
	};
};
