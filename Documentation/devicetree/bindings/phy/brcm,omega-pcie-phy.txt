Broadcom Omega PCIe PHY

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "brcm,omega-pcie-phy"
- #address-cells: must be 1
- #size-cells: must be 0
- brcm,pciephy-crmu-syscon: a phandle to the crmu syscon area that contains phy
                            control regs.

PCIe PHY should be represented by a child node.

Required properties For the child node:
- reg: the PHY number, must be 0
- #phy-cells: must be 0

Example:
	pcie_phy: {
		compatible = "brcm,omega-pcie-phy";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		brcm,pciephy-crmu-syscon = <&crmu_syscon>;

		pcie0_phy: phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
		};
	};

	/* users of the PCIe phy */

	pcie0: pcie@28420000 {
		...
		...
		phys = <&pcie0_phy>;
		phy-names = "pcie-phy";
	};
