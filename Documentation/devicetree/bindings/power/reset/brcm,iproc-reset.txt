Device tree binding for broadcom iproc reset functionality.

The system reset is implemented in the M0 processor.
A message is sent to M0 via the mailbox driver which would
contain a command to reset. This command when received at M0
triggers the reset sequence.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "brcm,iproc-reset".
- mboxes: list of phandle and mailbox channel specifier,
used for communication with a power management co-processor.

Examples:

		iproc-reset {
			compatible = "brcm,iproc-reset";
			mboxes = <&mailbox 0>;
		};
