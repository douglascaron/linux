Broadcom Omega System Control Processor Device Tree Bindings

The Omega System Control Processor(SCP) is responsible for power state
transitions, and system functionality in low power states. For instance, it
- Configure the state of AON regulators during low power modes.
- Configure the state of LED during low power modes.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "brcm,omega-scp".
- mboxes: A phandle specifying the mailbox controller and channel used to
    communicate with the scp.

Each configuration should be represented by a child node

Mandatory properties for the child node:
- brcm,pm-function: function to be configured for the node. Valid options are
    "regulator" and "led".

Optional properties for the child node:
- brcm,pm-supply: phandle to power management regulator.
- brcm,pm-regulator-off-in-mem-state: regulator should be disabled by scp while
    in suspend-to-ram-state. If this node is missing the regulator state is not
    modified upon entering and exiting suspend-to-ram state.
- brcm,pm-regulator-off-in-off-state: regulator should be disabled by scp while
    in OFF mode. If this node is missing the regulator state is not modified
    upon entering and exiting OFF state.
- brcm,led-gpio: phandle to gpio that controls led.
- brcm,led-onoff: on and off periods in msec during low power state.

Mandatory properties for the regulator node:
- gpio: gpio to use for enable control

Optional properties for the regulator node:
- startup-delay-us: startup time in microseconds
- enable-active-high: Polarity of GPIO is Active high

Example:

	scp: scp {
		compatible = "brcm,omega-scp";
		mboxes = <&mailbox 0>;

		scp0: scp@0 {
			brcm,pm-function = "regulator";
			brcm,pm-supply = <&vdd_reg>;
			brcm,pm-regulator-off-in-mem-state;
			brcm,pm-regulator-off-in-off-state;
		};

		scp1: scp@1 {
			brcm,pm-function = "regulator";
			brcm,pm-supply = <&xyz_reg>;
			brcm,pm-regulator-off-in-mem-state;
		};

		scp2: scp@2 {
			brcm,pm-function = "led";
			brcm,led-gpio = <&gpio_crmu 3 0>;
			brcm,led-onoff = <2 3>;
		};
	};
