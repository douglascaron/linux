Broadcom BCM281xx Soc NAND controller DT binding

The Broadcom BCM281XX NAND controller provides an interface to control
the NAND flash chips for bcm28155_ap based platforms.

Required properties:

- compatible:  Should be "brcm,nand-bcm281xx".
- reg:         The base physical address and size of
               NAND controller's registers.
- clocks:      The clocks needed by the NAND controller
- clock-names: Should contain the clock name "nand_clk".
- status:      Disabled default. Then set "okay" by platform.

Example:

nand: nand@3f110000 {
	compatible = "brcm,nand-bcm281xx";
	reg = <0x3f110000 0x10000>;
	clocks = <&master_ccu BCM281XX_MASTER_CCU_NAND>;
	clock-names = "nand_clk";
	status = "disabled";
};
