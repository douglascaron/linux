Broadcom Omega PWM controller device tree bindings

This controller has 4 channels.

Required Properties :
- compatible: must be "brcm,omega-pwm"
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- clocks: phandle + clock specifier pair for the external clock
- #pwm-cells: Should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a
  description of the cells format.

Refer to clocks/clock-bindings.txt for generic clock consumer properties.

Example:

pwm: pwm@28580000 {
	compatible = "brcm,omega-pwm";
	reg = <0x28580000 0xc90>;
	clocks = <&clk_periph_apb>;
	#pwm-cells = <3>;
};
