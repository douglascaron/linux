Generic dummy codec driver for Broadcom test

This driver is similar to the "dummy" driver found in the ASoC
framework, but we are allowing this driver to be a continuous
frame rate up to a maximum of 384 kHz.  Also, this driver uses
device tree, allowing the codec to be added in the card driver
via of nodes.

Required properties:
- compatible: "brcm,dummy_codec"
