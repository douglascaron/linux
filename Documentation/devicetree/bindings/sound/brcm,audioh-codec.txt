AudioH - Broadcom integrated codec driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: "brcm,audioh"
- #sound-dai-cells: must be equal to 1
- reg: the register address of the device.
- reg-names: should be "audioh"
- clocks: clock for the audioh codec
- clock-names: should be "codec_clk"
- interrupts: the codec's interrupt
- brcm,audioh-crmu-syscon:  a phandle to the crmu syscon area that contain a
                            few of the codec's regs

Example:
  	omega_codec: audioh@29490000 {
		#sound-dai-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "brcm,audioh";
		reg = <0x29490000 0xc000>;
		reg-names = "audioh";

		brcm,audioh-crmu-syscon = <&crmu_syscon>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 175 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

		clocks = <&codec_clock>;
		clock-names = "codec_clk";

		status = "disabled";
	};
