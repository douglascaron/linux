ASoC machine driver Omega SVK.

This audio driver should work for all of the following SVK variants
	bcm95831x15k
	bcm95831x17k

Required properties:
- compatible: "brcm,omega-svk-machine"
- brcm,audio-routing:  A list of the connections between audio components.
  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the connection's sink,
  the second being the connection's source.

In addition to these properties, the device follows the general construct
of the multi-dai generic "simple audio card".  Refer to simple-card.txt.

The only valid dai properties for this design are
 - format
 - bitclock-master
 - frame-master

The SVK is used as verification platform, therefore, it includes some ability
to configure the properties of a dai link via the debugfs.
The following optional properties will provide the default values for these
properties.

Each node also has these optional properties:
 - brcm,transfer_mode: 0 for i2s, 1 for tdm
 - brcm,slave_mode: if the DAI is alave
 - brcm,tdm_framesize: size (in bits) of the tdm frame
 - brcm,slot_size:  size of TDM slot (16 or 32)

Example:

sound {
	compatible = "brcm,omega-svk-machine";
	status = "okay";

	brcm,audio-routing =
