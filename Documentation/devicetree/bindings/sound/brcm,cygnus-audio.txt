BROADCOM Cygnus Audio I2S/TDM/SPDIF controller

Required properties:
	- compatible : "brcm,cygnus-audio"
	- #address-cells: 32bit valued, 1 cell.
	- #size-cells:  32bit valued, 0 cell.
	- reg : Should contain audio registers location and length
	- reg-names: names of the registers listed in "reg" property
		Valid names are "aud" and "i2s_in". "aud" contains a
		set of DMA, I2S_OUT and SPDIF registers. "i2s_in" contains
		a set of I2S_IN registers.
	- interrupts: audio DMA interrupt number

Optional properties:
	- assigned-clocks: only valid choice is audiopll
	- assigned-clock-rates: clock frequency for audiopll
If none of the ports need an internal master clock then there no need to
initialize the pll clock.


SSP Subnode properties:
Required:
	- reg: The index of ssp port interface to use
		Valid value are 0, 1, 2, or 3 (for spdif)
Optional:
	- clocks: clock used by audio port
		  one of the audiopll outputs (see brcm,iproc-clocks.txt).
	- clock-names: Must be "ssp_clk"
	- brcm,ssp-clk-mux = Needed if a clock is named and used.  This value is
			used to program the mux within the audio driver which selects
			the incoming clock. Here is the mapping.
			audio_pll   output 0 = 0, output 1 = 1, and output 2 = 2


Example:
	cygnus_audio: audio@180ae000 {
		compatible = "brcm,cygnus-audio";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x180ae000 0xafd>, <0x180aec00 0x1f8>;
		reg-names = "aud", "i2s_in";

		assigned-clocks = <&audiopll BCM_CYGNUS_AUDIOPLL>;
		assigned-clock-rates = <1376255989>;

		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 143 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

		ssp0: ssp_port@0 {
			reg = <0>;

			clocks = <&audiopll BCM_CYGNUS_AUDIOPLL_CH0>;
			clock-names = "ssp_clk";
			brcm,ssp-clk-mux = <0>;

			status = "okay";
		};

		ssp1: ssp_port@1 {
			reg = <1>;

			clocks = <&audiopll BCM_CYGNUS_AUDIOPLL_CH1>;
			clock-names = "ssp_clk";
			brcm,ssp-clk-mux = <1>;

			status = "okay";
		};

		ssp2: ssp_port@2 {
			reg = <2>;

			clocks = <&audiopll BCM_CYGNUS_AUDIOPLL_CH2>;
			clock-names = "ssp_clk";
			brcm,ssp-clk-mux = <2>;

			status = "okay";
		};

		spdif: spdif_port@3 {
			reg = <3>;

			clocks = <&audiopll BCM_CYGNUS_AUDIOPLL_CH2>;
       			clock-names = "ssp_clk";
			brcm,ssp-clk-mux = <2>;

			status = "disabled";
		};
