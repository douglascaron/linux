Cypress Bluetooth voice audio codec driver

This driver does not actual interface with a Bluetooth device it just
creates an ASoC dai that is used to model the properties for the
voice interface on Cypress Bluetooth chips.

Required properties:
- compatible : "cypress,bt_voice_codec"
-cypress,bt-voice-link-mode : "i2s" or "tdm"

  If "tdm" is specificed
  - cypress,bt-voice-tdm-kbps : bit per second on the link. The BT chip expects
                            a constants bps regardless for frame rate.
			    For example, 2048 kbps would have 256 bpf at 8kHz
			    but 128 bpf at 16 kHz.

Example:

bt_voice_codec {
	compatible = "cypress,bt_voice_codec";

	cypress,bt-voice-link-mode = "i2s";
};

Example using TDM:

bt_voice_codec {
	compatible = "cypress,bt_voice_codec";

	cypress,bt-voice-link-mode = "tdm";
	cypress,bt-voice-tdm-kbps = <2048>;
};
