Broadcom Unicam CPI (Camera Parallel Interface) driver
------------------------------------------------------
Overview
CPI is the camera interface HW IP present in Cygnuc SoC.
This is derived from Unicam IP groups. CPI interface as the name
suggest support only parallel interface. It receives data from the
Parallel interface Image sensor and dumps it to memory. It works on
HSYNC and VSYNC received from Image sensor and generates, Frame Start
And Frame End Interrupts. CPI Drivers state machine works based on
these interrupts. This Driver acts as the "soc-camera" host camera driver in
soc-camera subsystem methodology.

This controller is used in the following Broadom SoC's:
Cygnus

Required properties:
- compatible			: "brcm,unicamcpi"
- asiu-syscon			: phandle of asiu registers needed for camera
- mclk-src-syscon		: phandle of mclk src select for camera
- id				: Camera ID
- reg				: Physical base address and length of the
				registers set for the device
- interrupts			: IRQ line for the CPI
- data-width			: Data width in bits
- clocks			: Source for reference clock generation
- clock-names			: Reference clock name. Must be "cam-clock"
- clock-frequency  		: Reference clock frequency

Unicam CPI supports a single port node with parallel bus. It can contain one
'port' child node with child 'endpoint' node. Please refer to the bindings
defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

	unicam: camera@180a1000 {
		compatible = "brcm,unicamcpi";
		asiu-syscon = <&camera_asiu>;
		mclk-src-syscon = <&camera_pllclk_select>;
		id = <0>;
		reg = <0x180a1000 0x5ff>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 145 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		data-width = <8>;
		clocks = <&audiopll_clks BCM_CYGNUS_AUDIOPLL_CH2>;
		clock-names = "cam-clock";
		clock-frequency = <24576000>;
		port {
                        #address-cells = <1>;
                        #size-cells = <0>;

			unicam_0: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&ov5640_0>;
				bus-width = <8>;
			};
                };
	};

	camera_asiu: syscon@180aa000 {
		compatible = "syscon";
		reg = <0x180aa000 0x84>;
	};

	camera_pllclk_select: syscon@180aedcc {
                compatible = "syscon";
                reg = <0x180aedcc 0x04>;
        };
