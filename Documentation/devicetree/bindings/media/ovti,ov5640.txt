Omnivision OV5640 Digital Image Sensor
--------------------------------------
The Omnivision OV5640 is a 1/4-Inch CMOS active pixel digital image sensor
with an active array size of 2592H x 1944V. It supports both parallel and
serial data interface.In Cygnus,we use parallel data interface.

Required Properties:
- compatible	: value should be "ovti,ov5640"
- reg		: address on the i2c bus.

The device node must contain one 'port' child node for its digital output
video port, in accordance with the video interface bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

	i2c0: i2c@18008000 {
		...

		ov5640: camera@3c {
			compatible = "ovti,ov5640";
			reg = <0x3c>;

			port {
				ov5640_0: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&unicam_0>;
					bus-width = <8>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
