Broadcom Bluetooth RFKILL Driver

Required Properties:
- compatible: Must be "brcm,bt-rfkill"
- brcm,rfkill-regulator: List of phandles to regulator nodes. These regulators
    are disabled when the rfkill state is set to 0 and enabled when set to 1.

Optional Properties:
- bt-dev-wake-gpio: Device wake GPIO.
- bt-host-wake-gpio: Host wake GPIO.

Example:

bluetooth {
	compatible = "brcm,bt-rfkill";
	brcm,rfkill-regulator = <&rf_reg0>;
	bt-dev-wake-gpio = <&gpio_asiu 87 0>;
	bt-host-wake-gpio = <&gpio_crmu 4 0>;
};
