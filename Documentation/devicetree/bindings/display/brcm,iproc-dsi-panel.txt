- brcm,scrn-on	: Panel on commands.
		Array of bytes where each command takes two bytes.
		First byte specifies the command type (Refer DSI DCS spec)
		Second byte is the actual command.
- brcm,scrn-off	: Panel off commands.
		Array of bytes where each command takes two bytes.
		First byte specifies the command type (Refer DSI DCS spec)
		Second byte is the actual command.
- brcm,slp-in	: Sleep in commands for the panel.
		Array of bytes where each command takes two bytes.
		First byte specifies the command type (Refer DSI DCS spec)
		Second byte is the actual command.
- brcm,slp-out	: Sleep out commands for the panel.
		Array of bytes where each command takes two bytes.
		First byte specifies the command type (Refer DSI DCS spec)
		Second byte is the actual command.
- brcm,init-panel: Panel initialization commands.
		Array of bytes where each command takes two bytes.
		First byte specifies the command type (Refer DSI DCS spec)
		Second byte is the actual command.
- panel-timing	: Display timing information (Refer to panel/display-timing.txt)

Optional properties:
- brcm,sync-pulses	: Enable sync-pulse which will make timing like DPI synchronizing
			pulse, remove it to enable for sync-event which does not require
			synchronizing pulse, rather it will use binary code as sync event.
