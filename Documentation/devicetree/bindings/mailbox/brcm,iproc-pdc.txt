The PDC driver manages DMA to and from SPU cryptographic acceleration hardware
on some Broadcom SoCs. An SoC may have multiple PDC hardware blocks. There is
one device tree entry per block.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "brcm,iproc-pdc".
- reg: Should contain PDC registers location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the PDC.
- #mbox-cells: 1
- brcm,rx_status_len: Length of metadata preceding received frames, in bytes.

Optional properties:
- brcm,use_bcm_hdr:  present if a BCM header precedes each frame.
- dma-coherent: Present if dma operations are coherent

Example:
	pdc0: iproc-pdc0@0x612C0000 {
		compatible = "brcm,iproc-pdc";
		reg = <0 0x612C0000 0 0x445>;  /* PDC FS0 regs */
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 187 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#mbox-cells = <1>;   /* one cell per mailbox channel */
		dma-coherent;
		brcm,rx_status_len = <32>;
		brcm,use_bcm_hdr;
	};
