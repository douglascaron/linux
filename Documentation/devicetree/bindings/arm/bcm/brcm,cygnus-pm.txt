Broadcom Cygnus Power Management Device Tree Bindings

The Cygnus power management driver configures and communicates with the M0 to
provide power management on Cygnus SoC's. The M0 is a low-power co-processor
dedicated to power management. The co-processor is configured with information
about the always-on (AON) regulators which can vary between board variants.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "brcm,cygnus-pm".
- reg: Defines the base addresses and length for ihost_scu_control, cru, and
    iproc_crmu.
- reg_names: Register names corresponding to 'reg'. Required: "scu", "crmu",
    "cru".
- mboxes: A phandle specifying the mailbox controller and channel used to
    communicate with the M0 processor.
- aon_regulators: A child node containing child aon_regulator nodes describing
    AON regulators, which need to be externally disabled while in certain PM
	states. The node has the following properties:

  Required properties:
  - gpio: gpio to use for enable control

  Optional properties:
  - startup-delay-us: Startup time in microseconds. If this property is missing,
      the default is 0.
  - enable-active-high: Polarity of GPIO is active high. If this property is
      missing, the default is active low.
  - regulator-state-standby: sub-root node for Standby. The device is in a
      power-saving state but can still receive certain events.
  - regulator-state-mem: sub-root node for Suspend-to-RAM (deepsleep). All data
      is stored in memory and only an external interrupt can wake the device.
  - regulator-state-off: sub-root node for Cygnus OFF mode. The core part of the
      device is powered off. Only an external interrupt can wake the
      co-processor. The device goes through a full boot on wakeup. If this node
	  is missing the regulator state is not modified upon entering and exiting
	  the corresponding PM state.
  - regulator-state-[standby/mem/off]: A node that has the following common
      properties:
      - regulator-off-in-suspend: regulator should be disabled by the PM
        co-processor while in the corresponding PM state. If this property is
	    missing the regulator state is not modified upon entering and exiting a
	    PM state.

Example:

	pm: pm@19020000 {
		compatible = "brcm,cygnus-pm";
		reg = <0x19020000 0x100>,
		      <0x03024024 0x7c>,
		      <0x1800e000 0x2000>;
		reg-names = "scu", "crmu", "cru";
		mboxes = <&mailbox 0>;

		aon_regulators {
			vdd_regulator {
				gpio = <&gpio_crmu 0 0>;
				enable-active-high;
				startup-delay-us = <1000>;
				regulator-state-mem {
					regulator-off-in-suspend;
				};
				regulator-state-off {
					regulator-off-in-suspend;
				};
			};
			rf_regulator0 {
				gpio = <&gpio_crmu 1 0>;
				enable-active-high;
				regulator-state-off {
					regulator-off-in-suspend;
				};
			};
			rf_regulator1 {
				gpio = <&gpio_crmu 2 0>;
				enable-active-high;
				regulator-state-off {
					regulator-off-in-suspend;
				};
			};
		};
	};
