Broadcom NVME/SSR data backup device tree binding

Required_properties:
	-compatible: must be "brcm,nvme-lpm-data-backup".
	- reg: memory address used for sharing SSR commands/data.
	- intrpt-gpio: GPIO that is asserted when PMIC detect 12V supply loss
		       and de-asserted when suply gets re-stored.
	- mboxes: list of phandle and mailbox channel specifier,
		  used for communication with a power management co-processor.
	- memory-region : phandle to a node describing reserved memory region
			  for sharing data of NVMe device used for data-backup
			  with power management co-processor.

Example:
	reserved-memory {
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		ranges;

		pci_lpm_region: pci_lpm_region@801f0000 {
			reg = <0x0 0x8f101000 0x0 0x1000>;
			no-map;
		};
	};

	nvme_lpm_data_backup: nvme-lpm-data-backup@14 {
		compatible = "brcm,nvme-lpm-data-backup";
		reg = <0x0 0x100>;
		intrpt-gpio = <&gpio_hsls 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		mboxes = <&mailbox 0>;
		memory-region = <&pci_lpm_region>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
