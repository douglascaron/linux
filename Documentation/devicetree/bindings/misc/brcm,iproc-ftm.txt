Flextimer support for reading  magnetic stripe of smart cards.

Magnetic stripe reader head reads the smart card's magnetic stripe flux
and generates the analog signal. This signal is digitalized and fed to
flex time which time stamp the data. Time stamp is decoded to get the stripe
tracks data.


Required properties:

- compatible:
    Must be "brcm,iproc-ftm"

-reg:
	base address of flex channels registers.

-flextimer_syscon:
	handler of syscon node defining physical base address of the
	TS/ADC controller and length of memory mapped region.

-interrupts:
	interrupt line used by flex timer.

-clocks and clock-names:
	clock used in flex timer.clock-names must be "ftm_clk".

-pinctrl-0:
	configure the mux to activate pin for flex timer functionalites.

For example:

	ts_adc_syscon: ts_adc_syscon@180a6000 {
		compatible = "brcm,iproc-ts-adc-syscon", "syscon";
		reg = <0x180a6000 0xc30>;
	};

	flextimer: flextimer@180a6000 {
		compatible = "brcm,iproc-ftm";
		flextimer_syscon = <&ts_adc_syscon>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 164 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&asiu_clks BCM_CYGNUS_ASIU_ADC_CLK>;
		clock-names = "ftm_clk";
		pinctrl-0 = <&flextimer_default_mux>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
