Broadcom Smart Card Reader driver used for chip based Cards.

Required properties:

- compatible:
	Must be "brcm,smart-card"

-reg:
	base address of SCI registers

-reg-names:
	Should contain strings with the following names, each
	representing a specific internal memory region.
	list of reg-names
	"sc-uart-cmd1".

-sc_syscon:
	handler of syscon node defining interrupt registers base address of the
	smartcard interface and length of memory mapped region.

-interrupts:
	One interrupt line is used by each SCI.

-interrupt-names:
	A list of interrupt names. Should contain (if present):
		- "sci-irq" for smartcard interface,

-clocks:
	Smart Card Clock from lcpll0 Ch4.
	Clock ungate from ASIU.

-pinctrl-0:
	mux setting used to configure pins for smart card.

-sci-id:
	Smart Card Id. 0 for first smart card interface and 1 for second.

-nxp-coupler:
	Coupler used for interfacing between card and controller.
	0 for NXP8024, 1 for NXP8026(with i2c1)

For example:

	smartcard_syscon: smartcard_syscon@180a3200 {
		compatible = "brcm,smart-card-syscon", "syscon";
		reg = <0x180a3200 0x28>;
	};

	smartcard0: smartcard@180a3000 {
		compatible = "brcm,smart-card";
		reg = <0x180a3000 0x100>;
		reg-names = "sc-uart-cmd1";
		sc_syscon = <&smartcard_syscon>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 161 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "sci-irq";
		clocks = <&lcpll0 BCM_CYGNUS_LCPLL0_SMART_CARD_CLK>,
			<&asiu_clks BCM_CYGNUS_ASIU_SMARTCARD_CLK>;
		pinctrl-0 = <&smartcard_0>;
		sci-id = <0>;
		nxp-coupler = <0> ;
		/* 0 for NXP8024, 1 for NXP8026(with i2c1) */
		 * NXP8024 and NXP8026 are smartcard interfaces/slots.
		 * NXP8024 is IC based interface and not i2c.
		 * NXP8026 is i2c based interface and supports multiple slots.

		status = "disabled";
