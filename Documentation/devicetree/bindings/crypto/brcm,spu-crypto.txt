The Broadcom Secure Processing Unit (SPU) driver supports symmetric
cryptographic offload for Broadcom SoCs with SPU hardware. A SoC may have
multiple SPU hardware blocks.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "brcm,spum-crypto" for devices with SPU-M hardware
  (e.g., Northstar2), or "brcm,spu2-crypto" for devices with SPU2 hardware
  (e.g., Pegasus, Stingray).
- reg: Should contain SPU registers location and length.
- mboxes: A list of mailbox channels to be used by the kernel driver. Mailbox
channels correspond to DMA rings on the device.
- brcm,max-pkt-size: Maximum payload length of a SPU message, in bytes. The max
  pkt size must be a multiple of the hash and cipher block sizes, so that
  when the driver breaks a request into chunks, the chunks are a multiple of
  block size.

Example:
	spu-crypto@612d0000 {
		compatible = "brcm,spum-crypto";
		reg = <0 0x612d0000 0 0x900>,    /* SPU 0 control regs */
			<0 0x612f0000 0 0x900>,  /* SPU 1 control regs */
			<0 0x61310000 0 0x900>,  /* SPU 2 control regs */
			<0 0x61330000 0 0x900>;  /* SPU 3 control regs */
		mboxes = <&pdc0 0>,
			<&pdc1 0>,
			<&pdc2 0>,
			<&pdc3 0>;
		brcm,max-pkt-size = <65536>;
	};
