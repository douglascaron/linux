Valkyrie Card Status using SysFS
================================

The bcm-vk driver supports the query of the Valkyrie card status using the
SysFs entry.

A Group attribute is created to report the valkyrie card status
(vk-card-status) and different status values are consolidated under the
card status group.

The organization of the card status is given below.

The group is created under the following : /sysfs/devices/<pci device number>/

vk-card-status/
	firmware-status
	firmware-version
	voltage		---> reports the 1.8v and 3.3v voltage rail readings
	temperature	---> reports the current temperature of the soc

The sysfs entry supports only the read operation.

Example:
To read the temperature from a PCIe device at 65:00.0:
cat /sys/devices/pci0000:64/0000:64:00.0/0000:65:00.0/vk-card-status/voltage

where
	/sys/devices/pci0000:64/0000:64:00.0/0000:65:00.0/ --> path of bcm-vk device
	vk-card-status/voltage --> current voltage reading from the card
